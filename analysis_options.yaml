# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  exclude: [ build/** ]
  language:
    # strict-casts: true # ensures that the type inference engine never implicitly casts from dynamic to a more specific type
    strict-inference: true #  ensures that the type inference engine never chooses the dynamic type when it can’t determine a static type
    strict-raw-types: true # ensures that the type inference engine never chooses the dynamic type when it can’t determine a static type due to omitted type arguments
  errors:
    unused_element: ignore # suppress issues with Widget({super.key})...

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at
  # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/index.html.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    always_use_package_imports: true
    require_trailing_commas: true
    use_super_parameters: true
    prefer_single_quotes: true
    avoid_relative_lib_imports: true
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
